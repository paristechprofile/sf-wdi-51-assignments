                <p>Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Even the worst thing we can do here is good. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Play with the angles. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Very easy to work these to death. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>

                <p>These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Just a little indication. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. This is the fun part We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Learn when to stop. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.</p>
